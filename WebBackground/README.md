# Web Page Backgrounds

This is a project I created out of an idea I had to allow for the creation of customizable shape based patterned backgrounds for a web page.

It is structured with customizability in mind. Shapes can be changed to any shape using CSS clip-path, they can be offset to make different patterns, as well as have many different shapes within the pattern. The pattern area can even be resized and moved if you are just wanting the pattern in a specific section of the screen.

It is all done with basic CSS, HTML, and Javascript. It also contains an element that can optionally follow the mouse, above or bellow the shapes, as well as trigger a ripple effect on click.
