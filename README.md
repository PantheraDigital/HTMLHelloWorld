# WebPageProjects

This is a repository I am using to hold my web based projects that I am using to explore and learn about HTML, CSS, and Javascript.<br>
Files of some projects can be found on this branch as well as on different branches so that I may use Github pages to have the project run in browser.<br><br>

Check out the page I have for myself at https://pantheradigital.github.io/
<br>Play my first browser game at https://pantheradigital.github.io/WebPageProjects/
<br>Find my gradient web page [here](https://pantheradigital.github.io/WebGradientMaker/) and its github page [here](https://github.com/PantheraDigital/WebGradientMaker)
