# WebPageProjects

This is a repository I am using to hold my web based projects that I am using to explore and learn about HTML, CSS, and Javascript.<br>
Folders in this branch contain different projects. The other branch in this repo is used in github pages to allow the project to run in browser.<br><br>

Check out the page I have for myself at https://pantheradigital.github.io/
<br>Play my first browser game at https://pantheradigital.github.io/WebPageProjects/   It can be found on the second branch in this repo.
<br>Find my gradient web page [here](https://pantheradigital.github.io/WebGradientMaker/) and its github page [here](https://github.com/PantheraDigital/WebGradientMaker)
